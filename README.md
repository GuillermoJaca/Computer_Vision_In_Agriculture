# Computer Vision In Agriculture

Agriculture is the basis of our food and without its automation it would be impossible to supply all human beings. In this Final Degree Project (TFG) a solution is proposed for the controlled automation of irrigation and fumigation in corn crops in order to save the process and avoid unnecessary contamination.
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) take photos of the studied field. The maize plants and weeds are then detected by color filters and, in the case of weeds, also by position parameters.

By means of the position and size of the corn plants, the parameter of ‘Nacency index’ is calculated, which is the quotient between the real and theoretical plants. This parameter is calculated by zones in order to act by intensifying the risks in the zones in which said parameter is low. On the other hand, the location of the weeds allows a more controlled use of the fumigant products. All this information favors economic savings and, above all, of polluting products.
It should be noted that, despite performing a color detection, the system is not sensitive to possible changes in the brightness of the photos, since the detection color range is chosen in each ortho-photo.

The application to a complete field and the testing of its effectiveness, as well as the implementation of the code coordinating it with the spraying and irrigation elements opens the way to future lines of research.
